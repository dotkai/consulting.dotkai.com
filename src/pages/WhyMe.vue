	<h1 class="display-2 font-weight-light ma-5">Hi! I'm Kai.</h1>
	<p>I'm an author, artist, full stack web developer, teacher, engineer, photographer, actor, and multipotentialite. Basically, I do a lot of things. All of them involve telling stories.</p>
	<p> Chances are, if you're here, you have a story of your own to tell. Maybe you know what you want your story to be or how you want to tell it (eg. novel, blog post, video, etc.), but you don't know where to begin. Maybe you know your story, but you don't know what it should be or how to tell it or who it might be good for. Maybe you're already on the journey, but feel like you've lost your way. Maybe you just need someone to talk to.</p>
	<p>Of course, there are plenty of creative communities out there. I'm part of a few great ones myself.</p>
	<p>That's what I'm here for. You can schedule time out of my day just for you! Like how a developer debugs an app, or a therapist helps you work through your brain, I'm here to help you work through your stories -- whatever your story or medium may be.</p>
