	q: `Are there any stories you won't consult?`,
	a: [`Yes. While I'm extremely open minded, for various reasons, there are projects I cannot accept.`,
		`* "Is this a good idea?" consultations. I'm not here to tell you if your idea is good or bad. I don't care if an idea is original or cliche. I'm here to help you make something and help you ensure that something is the best it can be. Better question: "Are you willing to put in the effort for that?"`,
		`* Romance or erotica. I'm aromantic asexual. I'm the opposite of your target audience. If your story has these elements and you can work around them, however, then it should be fine. The vast majority of fiction involves some sort of romantic subplot already. But I'd prefer not to comment on that.`,
		`* Anything with or I suspect to have a political or religious/spiritual agenda. The nature of consultation involves me questioning your logic, offering alternative points of view, and all the things that can turn you trying to tell your story into an uncomfortable situtation for both of us.`,
		`* Character consultations where I'm asked about specific details regarding the life of people I haven't lived (especially since you can ask them yourself). For example, I'm white and American. I was raised in a middle-class Christian home. I don't know what it's like to be black and Canadian or raised in a poor Buddist home. I can tell you where to find these people. They have wonderful buckets of their own stories to share. But Google will do that for free. My only advice is just write people. Space aliens and fantasy creatures on the other hand...`

	q: `Are you LGBT+ friendly?`
	a: [`Yes.`,
		// `And because I know some reading this will have the confusion: This is not a political/religious topic. LGBT+ people exist. So do Christians, child beauty pageants, serial killers, the Star Wars franchise, the color red, mosquitos, and puppies. Whether or not you think they should be allowed to exist is a completely different matter. I've enjoyed stories that've involved all these things. I've enjoyed stories that haven't.`,
		`That said, per my answer to things I won't consult, I can't give you advice on what it's like to actually be certain members of the LGBT+ community.`
