	q: `I don't feel comfortable sharing my ideas. How do I know you won't steal them?`,
	a: `Chances are, if you're asking it, you're new to the creative and collaborative world. I know it's a terrifying place. There are horror stories of people who've had their story stolen. Why would you trust some stranger on the internet who possibly has greater skill than you in breathing life into your creation? You're clearly outmatched. 

		But there's a sugar-coated answer and a painful answer to this question. 

		Sugar-coated:
		Turning an idea into a product takes a lot of time and effort. It's not an easy task. Then you have to go through the whole marketing process, which is not easy (and much less fun) too. Furthermore, those who "have the skills" (aka, creatives, entrepreneuirs, etc.) have a backlog of their own ideas they're in love with too.

		Suppose hypothetically I liked your idea enough to want to steal it. It's not like I haven't based my stories off other people's idea before. Sinteren, for example, is based off Cinderella and German mythology. My Blood Mark series began as a Teen Titan fanfiction, then began to take on heavy influence of The Child Called It, 1984, X-men, and the Left Behind Series. As I have only 24/hours per day, roughly 30 projects in my backlog at the time of this website (not all of which are books), and 200+ other project ideas I'd like to get to (a new one comes every few days), your idea would have to get in line behind those.

		This is why some creatives choose to hire ghostwriters, artists, developers, etc. Because there is purely not enough daylight. (Honestly, if someone wants to turn my own ideas into something worthwhile, please do so. I'm drowning here... I'm also open to co-creators.)

		When I finally get around to your idea 20+ years, I'd then spend the next year of my life combining it with other ideas I've collected over time, putting it through my own personal style and genre filter to the point where your idea (if it makes it to that far), becomes nothing more than salt in an apple pie.



		Painful: 
		Your idea isn't original and it doesn't mean anything unless you actually do something with it.

		That's why I'm here. To help you begin your journey with more confidence in yourself and your idea, as a veteran and creator who lives and breaths that life.

	q: `Are there any project ideas, topics, or genres you won't consult?`,
	a: `* Romance or erotica. I'm aromantic asexual. I'm the opposite of your target audience.
		* Anything with or I suspect to have a non-fiction political or religious/spiritual agenda. Just like the former, I'm likely not your target audience and what is supposed to be collaboration can quickly crumble into a debate.
		However, if you have elements that can work around these things, I can help. Please run any concerns by me in advance.`

	q: `Are you LGBT+ friendly?`
	a: `Yes.`
		// And because I know some reading this will have the confusion: This is not a political/religious topic. Gay people exist. So do child beauty pageants, serial killers, mosquitos, and puppies. Whether or not you think they should be allowed to exist is a completely different matter. I've enjoyed stories that've involved them. I've enjoyed stories that haven't.
